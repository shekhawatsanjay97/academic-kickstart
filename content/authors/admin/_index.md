I am a second year Dphil student in Computer Vision at the [Department of Engineering Science](http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/) working under the supervision of [Prof. Philip Torr](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~tvg/index.php) where I work closely with [Dr. Puneet Dokania](https://puneetkdokania.github.io/). I am lucky enough to be supervised by some remarkable researchers from Adobe [Richard Zhang](https://richzhang.github.io/) ,[Eli Shechtman](https://research.adobe.com/person/eli-shechtman/), [Oliver Wang](http://www.oliverwang.info/) , [Alyosha Efros](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~efros/).

### Research

The central goal of my research is to be able to generate and edit realistic images with very sparse user interaction. I am also interested in Generative Models based on Generative Adversarial Networks and Unsupervised Learning in general.
