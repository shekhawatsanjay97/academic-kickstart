Hey! I am a graduate with B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering from CTAE, Udaipur. I am lucky enough to be supervised by some remarkable researchers [Prof. Andreas Uhl](http://wavelab.at/member-uhl.shtml) ,[Roland Kwitt](http://rkwitt.org/), [Prof. Vikram M. Gadre](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/vmgadre) , [Bernhard Prommegger](http://wavelab.at/member-bprommeg.shtml).

### Research

My main research area includes pattern recognition, digital image forensics, biometrics (hand - and finger-veins, iris and face) and privacy enhancing technologies for biometric systems.
